                    Flutterwave was founded in 2016 by a team of Nigerian entrepreneurs led by Iyinoluwa Aboyeji and Olugbenga “GB” Agboola. The company emerged to solve a major problem in Africa—seamless and reliable payment infrastructure. At the time, African businesses struggled with fragmented banking systems, unreliable cross-border transactions, and poor access to global payment channels. Flutterwave set out to build a unified payment solution that could connect African merchants to the global economy.

                            Beyond payments, Flutterwave positions itself as a digital infrastructure company. Its products like Store, Invoices, and Checkout allow entrepreneurs to start selling online without needing coding skills. For many local sellers, especially in Nigeria, the ability to set up a simple online store and get paid instantly has been a game-changer. The company continues to add new tools that support freelancers, vendors, and enterprise companies in scaling their businesses.

                    Despite its success, Flutterwave hasn’t been without controversy. The brand has gone through regulatory scrutiny, public criticism, and internal challenges. Still, it has managed to maintain a large customer base and continues to expand into new markets. In many ways, Flutterwave represents the fast-moving, high-pressure world of African tech—full of innovation, growth, and the occasional storm that tests a company’s resilience.
